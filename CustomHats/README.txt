CUSTOM HAT RESOURCE PACK
========================

SETUP STEPS:

1. Add your texture file:
   - Create a 16x16 PNG image
   - Save it as: assets/minecraft/textures/item/hats/cool_hat.png
   
2. Zip the resource pack:
   - Select all files/folders in this CustomHats folder
   - Right-click → Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder
   - Name it: CustomHats.zip

3. Install in Minecraft:
   - Open Minecraft
   - Options → Resource Packs → Open Pack Folder
   - Copy CustomHats.zip into that folder
   - Enable it in Minecraft

4. Test in-game:
   - Run: /hattest
   - You should see your custom hat model!

NOTES:
- CustomModelData is set to 1 in the code
- You can use any 16x16 texture (or higher resolution)
- For now, it's just a simple 2D texture
- Later you can upgrade to 3D models if needed
